    "RNNs can be used to process inputs that occur naturally in time (such as an audio recording of speech or music represented as a stream of timestamped MIDI messages), but they can also be applied to material that has an order to it, even if it's not necessarly temporal in natures, such as written text (which can be read one character or one word at a time) or even written numbers or math equations (which can be read one digit or symbol at a time, from left to right, for instance.)  This is the problem we investigate today: looking at numbers such as \"1423\" as a sequence of digits ['1', '4', '2', '3'].\n",

You can also feed the network lots of counterexamples -- marking them, of course, as non-members of the category.  Can a deep neural network learn any of these categories?  All of them?
