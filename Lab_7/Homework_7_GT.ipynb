    "- Any transition within the taboo (barrier) states can keep the state unchanged. If you experiment, you will see that other encodings work as well since the value of a barrier states are always zero and there are no actions transitioning into these states. \n",

    "> **Hint:** It may help you create a pencil and paper sketch of the transitions, rewards, and probabilities or policy. This can help you to keep the bookkeeping correct. "
